Classification of legislation in Zambia; given a bill/act/Statutory Instrument, classify the type of legislation using machine learning dataset is created from the information on https://zambialii.org/legislation/all
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
In Zambia, there are three types of legislation: bills, acts, and statutory instruments. Bills are proposed laws that have not yet been passed by Parliament. Acts are laws that have been passed by Parliament and have received the President's signature. Statutory instruments are laws that are made by a Minister or other delegated authority under the authority of an Act of Parliament.
To classify a specific piece of legislation, it is important to first determine whether it is a bill, an act, or a statutory instrument. If it is a bill, it has not yet been passed by Parliament and is still being debated and revised. If it is an act, it has already been passed by Parliament and signed by the President. If it is a statutory instrument, it has been created by a Minister or other delegated authority under the authority of an Act of Parliament.
Once the type of legislation has been determined, it is also important to consider its content and purpose in order to fully understand its impact and significance.


1. Data Collection: First, you need to collect the data from the website. You can use web scraping techniques to extract the necessary information from the website. Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium can be helpful in this process.

2. Data Preprocessing: After collecting the data, you need to preprocess it. This can include cleaning the data, removing any irrelevant or duplicate information, and structuring the data in a suitable format for analysis. This step ensures that the dataset is ready for machine learning algorithms.

3. Feature Extraction: In this step, you can extract relevant features from the dataset which can help in classifying the legislation into bills, acts, and statutory instruments. Some possible features could be the presence of specific keywords, phrases, or patterns in the text.

4. Model Training: Next, you can use machine learning algorithms to train a model that can classify the legislation into the three categories. Some popular algorithms for text classification are Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or neural networks like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This will help you understand how well the model is able to classify the legislation based on the features extracted.
